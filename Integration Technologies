title: Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web Services Academy

The study gives the idea of the importance of justifying rising tuition fees in giving the quality educcation and employment opportunities.
In the study it focus on redesigning a cloud computing undergraduate with the help of Amazon Web Services Academy, with combining the academic theories with real world applications,
this helps and ensures that student will learn both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.
It is made to improve students engagement and for better learing also it help them to be ready for their careers in cloud computing

the goal- is to increase student practical skills and employment potential and build industry-ready capabilities.

This matters since- Employers are looking for graduates who bring problem-solving expertise combined with teamwork ability and practical challenge resolution skills beyond basic academic knowledge.
Students gained real-world experience with industry-grade products and training systems and career development opportunities within cloud computing and IoT and big data domains using the added AWS course components.

In order to achieve the study they Partnered with AWS Academy: The course at QMUL incorporated AWS Cloud Foundations educational materials including lectures and videos with hands-on labs and assessments embedded into the curriculum.
Trained the Trainers: Through AWS certification the instructor developed enhanced teaching and guidance capabilities for the students.
Focused on Careers: Lectures presented career routes in cloud computing which demonstrated the path from education to employment opportunities in the field.

So how it worked? Blended Learning: Students studied through blended learning which combined traditional classes with electronic learning materials and hands-on laboratory sessions.
Cloud Skills: The labs delivered instruction about virtualization in addition to cloud security and scalability topics.
Extras for Enthusiasts: Eager students who attended additional AWS sessions received preparation for certification exams.

The Results are Better Grades:
The percentage of students earning A grades rise to 42.9% during 2018-2019 although only 7.4% obtained this level just two years prior.
The failure rate for the course became lower when 9.2% students did not pass during 2018-2019 whereas 18.6% had failed before this period.

to close this report the joint effort between QMUL and AWS Academy demonstrated how industry collaboration transforms education into an engaging hands-on academic journey. 
Through curriculum redesign students experienced improved grades and better preparedness for professional opportunities. 
Real-world tools integrated into classroom instruction create advantages that benefit students as well as academic institutions.
